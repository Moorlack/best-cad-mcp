# best-cad-mcp

This maintained fork adds a read-only [architectural DWG candidate inventory](docs/architectural-analysis.md)
through `analyze_architectural_drawing`. It preserves handles and uncertainty;
structural calculations and building-code checks are not included in this first increment.

Engineering roadmap and implementation status: [BACKLOG.md](BACKLOG.md) (Russian).

Versioned engineering inputs and missing-data gates: [project cards](docs/project-card.md).

## Why best-cad-mcp

Most CAD automation stops at drawing primitives. Useful agent workflows also
need to know exactly **what** they are changing, **why** a target was selected,
and **whether** the result is correct.

| Handle-first control | Drawing understanding | Evidence before trust |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Scan real AutoCAD handles, query exact entities, and edit those handles instead of guessing from labels or pixels. | Build CAD-IR, semantic objects and graphs, dimension bindings, constraints, and validation reports in a local workspace. | Validate and dry-run CADPlans, execute explicitly, rescan, and compare structured and visual results. |

The server runs on the same Windows account as AutoCAD and communicates over
MCP stdio. It runs natively on the official MCP Python SDK 2.x, negotiates the
2026-07-28 protocol, and retains legacy client negotiation. AutoCAD remains the
source of truth; SQLite stores model-private context, scan results, and review
artifacts alongside the workspace. AutoCAD-facing tool calls are intentionally
serialized on one event-loop thread to preserve COM apartment safety.

## Live AutoCAD demo

> **Prompt:** Create a production-style A3 landscape bolted flange-coupling
> assembly drawing at true 1:1 size, with a longitudinal half-section, aligned
> end view, exploded schematic, true dimensions, differentiated hatching, an
> eight-item BOM, matching item leaders, technical requirements, and a
> controlled title block.

![Bolted flange-coupling assembly generated in a live AutoCAD session](docs/images/live-flange-coupling-demo.png)

This is the result of a live AutoCAD session, not a hand-authored SVG. The MCP
client loaded the shipped `precise_draw_from_spec` prompt, then ran 18 bounded
generation phases (162 steps). Its autonomous visual-repair loop used two
layout-repair plans (4 steps); three separately recorded, operator-authorized
presentation-only release-QA plans added 10 steps. Every plan was validated and
dry-run before transactional execution. The final
rescan indexed 91 entities; structured verification detected 129 semantic
objects, processed 7 true dimension annotations, and checked 134 constraints
(127 satisfied, 7 unknown, and none violated). Post-repair geometry validation reported zero
issues. The release plot was independently checked as a one-page landscape A3
PDF.

For reproducibility, the checked-in MCP client builds the deterministic
CADPlans used for this recorded run. The demo shows live execution of the
optimized prompt's guarded workflow, not an unscripted one-shot LLM
generation.

or other standards compliance.

## Quick start

### Requirements

- Windows
- AutoCAD 2020 or newer recommended, installed and licensed
- AutoCAD and the MCP client running as the same Windows user
- Python 3.11 or newer
- An MCP-compatible local client

### Install the package

```powershell
python -m pip install --upgrade best-cad-mcp
cad-mcp-doctor --check-autocad
```

For rendered overlays and visual-review helpers:

```powershell
python -m pip install --upgrade "best-cad-mcp[visual]"
cad-mcp-doctor --check-autocad --require-visual-export
```

Keep AutoCAD open, then configure your MCP client to launch `cad-mcp`.

### Codex

Codex supports both global `~/.codex/config.toml` and trusted,
project-scoped `.codex/config.toml` files. This minimal installed-package
configuration uses the curated `core` tool profile:

```toml
[mcp_servers.best-cad-mcp]
command = "cad-mcp"
cwd = 'C:\CAD\your-project'
enabled = true
startup_timeout_sec = 30
tool_timeout_sec = 120
default_tools_approval_mode = "writes"

[mcp_servers.best-cad-mcp.env]
CAD_MCP_TOOL_PROFILE = "core"
CAD_MCP_WORKSPACE_ROOT = 'C:\CAD\your-project'
```

Restart Codex after editing the file, then inspect the connected server with
`/mcp`. See the
[official Codex MCP configuration guide](https://developers.openai.com/codex/mcp)
for configuration scopes and current options.

### Claude Code and other JSON-configured clients

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "best-cad-mcp": {
      "command": "cad-mcp",
      "env": {
        "CAD_MCP_TOOL_PROFILE": "core",
        "CAD_MCP_WORKSPACE_ROOT": "C:\\CAD\\your-project"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Save this as `.mcp.json` in the CAD project root and start the client from that
project. `CAD_MCP_WORKSPACE_ROOT` should point to the CAD project being worked
on, not to this repository. With an installed package, setting both the process
`cwd` and workspace root to the project keeps runtime files together.

<details>
<summary>Install from source</summary>

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/LokmenoWer/best-cad-mcp.git
cd best-cad-mcp
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -e ".[visual]"
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m src.doctor --check-autocad
```

For a source checkout, start `python -m src.server` from the repository or
set the MCP server `cwd` to the repository. Keep
`CAD_MCP_WORKSPACE_ROOT` pointed at the separate CAD project you want to
index.

</details>

## The guarded workflow

![Preflight, scan, dry-run, execute, and verify workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LokmenoWer/best-cad-mcp/master/docs/images/safe-workflow.svg)

1. **Preflight** — run `check_runtime_environment(check_autocad=true)` or
   `cad-mcp-doctor --check-autocad`; stop when the result reports `ok=false`.
2. **Scan** — run `scan_all_entities` before reasoning about an existing DWG.
   Use `topology_detail="full"` for primitive grounding or cross-entity profiles.
3. **Understand** — build CAD-IR, summarize the drawing, query semantics, and
   confirm important targets with `explain_entity`.
4. **Plan** — express multi-step changes as a CADPlan, then call
   `validate_cad_plan` and `dry_run_cad_plan`.
5. **Execute explicitly** — only after authorization and an acceptable dry-run,
   call `execute_cad_plan(..., allow_modify=true, transactional=true)`.
6. **Verify** — rescan, run geometric validation, export a clean view and
   overlay, and save only when the operator intends to persist the DWG.

For precise edits, prefer handles returned by AutoCAD over names inferred from
screenshots. For visual findings, treat grounding as evidence: confirm the
candidate entity and its geometry before changing it.

## What it can do

| Area | Representative capabilities |
| --- | --- |
| 2D drafting | Lines, polylines, curves, circles, regions, hatches, text, dimensions, leaders, tables, layers, blocks, and attributes |
| Editing | Move, copy, rotate, scale, mirror, offset, trim, extend, fillet, chamfer, arrays, properties, selections, and handle-targeted changes |
| Drawing understanding | SQLite scan, CAD-IR v2, summaries, semantic objects/graphs, constraints, dimension binding, validation, and repair proposals |
| Guarded automation | CADPlan variables, dependencies, captured handles, preconditions, postconditions, dry-runs, transactional execution, undo, and rollback attempts |
| Visual grounding | Clean exports, adaptive numeric overlays, pixel/world mapping, path and polygon grounding, tile crops, and VLM finding reconciliation |
| Image-to-CAD | ImageDrawingSpec tracing, calibration, fidelity checks, staged execution, and visual comparison against the source image |
| Mechanical drawings | Orthographic views, sections, hatches, centerlines, dimensions, BOMs, balloons, layouts, and assembly-oriented prompt/skill assets |
| 3D and output | 3D solids and operations, layouts, plotting, PDF/DXF/DWF/image export, and direct in-result image content |

### Tool profiles

The shipped client configs and examples recommend `core` because it keeps tool
selection reliable while covering normal guarded workflows. When the profile
environment variable is omitted, the Python server falls back to `full` for
backward compatibility.

| Profile | Tools | Intended use |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `lean` | 118 | Smallest dependable surface for common drawing and inspection tasks |
| `core` | 219 | Recommended default for full guarded CAD workflows |
| `full` | 326 | Every registered tool, including specialized and legacy operations |

Select a profile with `CAD_MCP_TOOL_PROFILE=lean|core|full`. Fine-grained
allow/deny controls are also available through
`CAD_MCP_TOOLS_INCLUDE` and `CAD_MCP_TOOLS_EXCLUDE`.

## From visual understanding to grounded CAD evidence

The hero is not an explanatory mockup. It was drawn in a new AutoCAD document
through a 90-step CADPlan, scanned as 81 real entities, validated with zero
geometry issues, exported as WMF, and rasterized to the PNG shown above. The
source DWG, plan, dry-run, validation output, pixel/world mapping, and VLM
review are retained as reviewable artifacts.

A VLM review should return more than a caption. Below are real artifacts from
the same snapshot: the clean AutoCAD tile inspected by the model and its actual
handle overlay. They are raster crops produced by the mapping tool, not redrawn
documentation graphics.

| Clean AutoCAD raster tile | Handle overlay from the same snapshot |
| --- | --- |
| ![Actual front-view tile supplied to visual review](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LokmenoWer/best-cad-mcp/master/docs/images/readme-cad-real_tiles/readme-cad-real_T002.png) | ![Actual mapped AutoCAD handles over the front-view tile](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LokmenoWer/best-cad-mcp/master/docs/images/readme-cad-real_tiles/readme-cad-real_T002_overlay.png) |

The overlay is registered to the WMF selection-export frame, not to the active
viewport. AutoCAD's measured proportional frame margin is preserved while the
old generic viewport padding is excluded. In this capture the mapped front-view
origin is `(734.870, 331.032)` px and the cyan centerline intersection observed
in the real raster is `(735, 331)` px: a maximum error of `0.13 px`.

The real `vlm_review_drawing/v3` result was schema-validated and submitted
without pre-claiming handles. Its four regions are authored from the raster and
locked to that raster's dimensions and SHA-256; the capture script rejects them
if AutoCAD produces a different image. Grounding resolved the central bore to handle
`8A`, the rounded mounting-slot profile to `115`, and the title-block semantic
group to `236`. The section hatch correctly remained ambiguous because two
real hatch candidates had a narrow score margin.

```json
{
  "central_bore":  {"status": "grounded",  "handles": ["8A"]},
  "mounting_slot": {"status": "grounded",  "handles": ["115"]},
  "section_hatch": {"status": "ambiguous", "handles": []},
  "title_block":   {"status": "grounded",  "handles": ["236"]}
}
```

### Copy a mechanical drawing from one image

The full path separates non-mutating understanding from the one explicitly
authorized DWG modification stage, then closes with a rescan and visual diff.
This README does not present a generated flow illustration as trace evidence;
a real run should retain the source raster, `ImageDrawingSpec`, validated and
dry-run CADPlan, resulting DWG, and final AutoCAD export.

A typical tracing loop is:

1. call `prepare_image_trace(image_path, domain="mechanical")`;
2. use `prepare_visual_semantic_context` and `get_trace_source_image` to inspect
   global and tiled source images;
3. produce `ImageDrawingSpec/v1`, echoing each observed image's
   `source_ref_template` for measured coordinates;
4. call `validate_image_drawing_spec`, then `submit_image_drawing_spec`;
5. call `compile_image_spec_to_cad_plan`;
6. call `validate_image_fidelity_contract(spec, cad_plan)`;
7. call `validate_cad_plan`, then `dry_run_cad_plan`;
8. only after authorization, call
   `execute_cad_plan(..., allow_modify=true, transactional=true)`;
9. rescan, validate, and compare the final AutoCAD export with the source.

Do not execute a trace just because its JSON is valid. Check view count,
symmetry, dimensions, centerlines, hole placement, and source/render fidelity
first.

## Visual grounding in v1.6

Version 1.6 adds drawing-level topology for boundaries assembled across
multiple entities, including line-line and supported line-curve intersections
plus closed-loop profiles. Use `scan_all_entities(topology_detail="full")` when
primitive relations are required. Grounding now carries real path/polygon
geometry, multiple-handle candidates, adaptive overlays, and tile-aware
pixel/world contracts.

This improves selection quality on mechanical profiles, but it does not make
vision infallible. Important edits should still follow:

```text
visual finding -> grounding candidates -> explain_entity -> handle-targeted edit
```

The default VLM review prompt is `vlm_review_drawing/v3`. Snapshot schema
versions are returned in tool results; overlay schema versions are stored in
the referenced sidecars so strict consumers can detect contract changes.

## Safety model

- Read and scan before editing an existing drawing.
- Keep raw command execution, deletion, purge, audit, save, close, and
  `execute_cad_plan` behind explicit client approval.
- Validate and dry-run plans before modification.
- Use returned handles and structured geometry for exact targets.
- Rescan after modifications; do not rely on stale SQLite rows.
- Keep model-private notes and spatial annotations in `.cad_mcp/`, not in
  visible DWG geometry, XData, or hidden layers.
- Treat saving and closing as separate operator decisions.
- Treat top/plan model-space views as the strongest grounding case. View twist,
  custom UCS, 3D geometry, and complex layout viewports can reduce confidence.

Transaction and rollback support reduce risk but cannot guarantee recovery from
every AutoCAD or COM failure. Work on copies when the drawing is valuable.

## Known limitations

- **View grounding is exact only for plan/top model-space views.** An
  untwisted plan view gives numerically stable world↔pixel mapping. View
  twist is included and flagged; non-plan and 3D views fall back to a 2D
  plan-view approximation with `transform_confidence=low` and explicit
  warnings; paperspace/layout viewport mapping is not fully supported. Carry
  returned `limitations` and confidence forward instead of claiming exact
  grounding in those cases.
- **Raster overlays need the `[visual]` extra.** Without Pillow/cairosvg the
  overlay degrades to an SVG fallback with a warning; WMF exports rely on the
  native Windows GDI+ conversion path.
- **Dimension binding is heuristic.** Dimensions are matched to candidate
  geometry with evidence and confidence; ambiguous or unbound dimensions stay
  `unknown` by design and are never reported as falsely satisfied.
- **Semantic detection is deterministic and rule-based.** Richer objects
  (slots, bolt-circle patterns, walls, doors, wires, title blocks, BOM
  tables) are reported as candidates with confidence, not guaranteed
  classifications, and no external model runs inside the server.
- **CADPlan executes a fixed operation set.** Advanced 3D solids, boolean
  operations, trim/extend, layout editing, plotting, and save/open are not
  plan operations; use the direct MCP tools for those.
- **Rollback is best-effort.** Transactional execution uses AutoCAD undo
  marks (`StartUndoMark`/`EndUndoMark` + undo); it cannot guarantee recovery
  from every COM or AutoCAD failure, and a failed plan always reports
  `completed_steps` for inspection.
- **Scans are bounded.** `scan_all_entities` honors `max_entities` and
  reports `truncated` when the drawing exceeds the cap; `topology_detail="full"`
  is expensive on large drawings, so use summary topology by default.
- **Image tracing depends on the agent-side VLM and calibration.** The server
  prepares, validates, compiles, and enforces fidelity; it never calls a
  model provider. Without reliable dimension calibration, traced drawings
  carry a scale warning and must not be claimed as true engineering scale.
- **Windows + AutoCAD COM only.** Tool calls are serialized on one COM
  thread, the server must run on the same Windows account as AutoCAD, and
  hosted CI cannot exercise live COM paths — live smoke benchmarks run
  locally via `scripts/verify_cad_understanding_workflow.py`.

## Workspace and data

`CAD_MCP_WORKSPACE_ROOT` controls
`<workspace>/.cad_mcp/workspace.db`. The default log, visual exports, and image
trace assets are written relative to the MCP process `cwd` as `cad_mcp.log`,
`cad_visual_exports/`, and `cad_image_traces/`.

External CAD projects are not ignored automatically. Add these entries to the
project's `.gitignore` when it is a Git repository:

```gitignore
.cad_mcp/
cad_mcp.log
cad_visual_exports/
cad_image_traces/
```

The database helps connect turns and tools, but AutoCAD remains authoritative.
If a drawing changes outside the server, scan it again before using stored
entities. A warning about a legacy root `autocad_data.db` means an older
database exists; verify migration, then archive it separately.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Check |
| --- | --- |
| Server fails to import after upgrading | Run `cad-mcp-doctor --json` with the same Python environment used by the client. best-cad-mcp 1.7+ requires MCP Python SDK `>=2,<3`; upgrade the package/environment and restart the client if `mcp_sdk_version` is blocked. |
| AutoCAD is open but unavailable | Run `cad-mcp-doctor --check-autocad`; make sure both processes use the same Windows account and privilege level. |
| Server starts with too many tools | Set `CAD_MCP_TOOL_PROFILE=core` or `lean`, then restart the client. |
| Visual export is unavailable | The `[visual]` extra provides Pillow for raster overlays. On Windows, AutoCAD WMF uses the native GDI+ fallback; ImageMagick/Wand, Inkscape, or LibreOffice provide alternate paths. Check `get_vision_capabilities()` and `wmf_to_png_available`; PDF can also be rasterized externally. |
| Queries return stale entities | Activate the intended drawing and rerun `scan_all_entities`. |
| MCP server starts in the wrong folder | Set server `cwd` to the source checkout only when developing; set `CAD_MCP_WORKSPACE_ROOT` to the CAD project. |
| A plan is rejected | Run `validate_cad_plan`, inspect the exact failing step, and dry-run again after correcting it. |

For machine-readable diagnostics:

```powershell
cad-mcp-doctor --json
```

## Development

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/LokmenoWer/best-cad-mcp.git
cd best-cad-mcp
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install -e ".[dev,visual]"
python -m pytest -q -m "not autocad_com"
```

Release publication validates the version, runs the non-COM suite (reserving
the `autocad_com` marker for local live-CAD checks), verifies native modern and
legacy MCP stdio, builds and clean-installs the wheel, checks it with Twine,
publishes to PyPI, and then publishes the MCP server metadata. Live AutoCAD
preflight and CADPlan checks must be run locally because hosted runners do not
have AutoCAD.

Contributions are welcome. Please keep changes scoped, add regression tests for
behavior changes, and preserve the scan → plan → validate → verify safety model.
