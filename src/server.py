CAD MCP Server — Comprehensive AutoCAD 2020+ MCP Server.

Registers 321 tools covering:
  - All drawing primitives (line, circle, arc, ellipse, spline, polyline, polygon, etc.)
  - Complete entity editing (move, rotate, copy, delete, mirror, scale, offset, array, explode)
  - Full layer management (CRUD, freeze/thaw, lock/unlock, isolate)
  - Text styles, MText, leaders, tables, find & replace
  - Dimensioning (linear, angular, radial, diametric, ordinate, baseline, continue, qdim)
  - Block creation, insertion, MInsert (block array), Xref management
  - View control (zoom, pan, layouts, named views, viewports, wipeout)
  - Selection sets, spatial queries, and scanning
  - SQLite-backed CAD metadata database with SQL query
  - File I/O (open, save, export PDF/DXF/DWF/image)
  - Undo/redo, system variables, raw command execution
  - 2D editing: fillet, chamfer, trim, extend, break, join, stretch, lengthen
  - Advanced entity properties: TrueColor, transparency, plot style

Architecture:
    server.py   → MCP tool definitions (this file)
    cad_tools/  → Tool implementations (logic, no MCP dependency)
    cad_controller.py → COM bridge to AutoCAD
    cad_database.py   → SQLite persistence
    cad_data_model.py → AI-readable data structures
    cad_utils.py      → Shared helpers

Start manually:
    python -m src.server

Or via Codex MCP config:
    [mcp_servers.best-cad-mcp]
    command = "python"
    args = ["-m", "src.server"]
    cwd = "C:/path/to/best-cad-mcp"
    default_tools_approval_mode = "approve"

Or via Claude Code project config:
    .mcp.json registers best-cad-mcp as:
      command = "python"
      args = ["${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR:-.}/src/server.py"]
    .claude/settings.json allows routine mcp__best-cad-mcp__* tool calls
    and asks before raw/destructive tools.

TOOL_SELECTION_INSTRUCTIONS = """
This AutoCAD MCP exposes hundreds of specialized CAD tools. Always choose the most
specific workflow and tool for the CAD intent before composing low-level
primitives. Treat the tool surface as indexed by intent, not as a flat list.

Closed-loop operating contract: Observe -> Plan -> Validate -> Execute -> Verify.
- Observe before acting. Before live CAD work, call
  check_runtime_environment(check_autocad=True). Inspect document, active space,
  units, and relevant styles. For an existing drawing, scan and build CAD-IR;
  capture a model-visible baseline with render_drawing_view when appearance,
  layout, or spatial context matters.
- Plan from explicit acceptance criteria: units, semantic objects/components,
  exact handles or relationships, layers/styles, dimensions, constraints,
  annotations/tables, and visual layout. Split large or high-risk work into
  independently verifiable semantic phases. Use one transaction per phase unless
  the user requires all-or-nothing execution; after any failed phase, rescan and
  rebuild the next plan instead of reusing stale handles or state.
- Validate without modifying the DWG. Validate image fidelity when applicable,
  validate_cad_plan, then dry_run_cad_plan. Resolve unsafe operations, missing
  variable bindings, schema errors, and unsupported/dangerous operations before
  execution. Runtime postconditions are evaluated during execution; broader
  acceptance criteria are checked after rescan.
- Execute with allow_modify=True and transactional=True when modification
  permission is already present in the request; otherwise obtain it first. Ask
  again when ambiguity, destructive scope, or a material scope expansion needs
  a new decision. Fail closed on partial results.
- Verify after each committed modification batch or semantic phase, and after a
  single direct edit. Never accept a modification as complete from the tool's
  success response alone. Rescan, rebuild relevant CAD-IR/semantics, rebind
  dimensions, recheck constraints, validate_geometry, and re-render when visual
  evidence matters. Compare the result against the acceptance criteria. Limit
  automatic verify/repair cycles to two unless the user explicitly asks to
  continue.

Evidence rules:
- Structured evidence is authoritative for identity and precision: handles,
  topology, CAD-IR, semantic groups, units, dimensions, constraints, and exact
  geometry. Visual evidence is authoritative for what is visible: composition,
  overlap, clipping, spacing, legibility, hatch appearance, and sheet layout.
- Use both channels for complex or appearance-sensitive work. If they conflict,
  inspect the relevant handles with explain_entity or selected full topology and
  keep the result uncertain until reconciled. Never draw helper geometry into
  the DWG as model memory.
- Rescan after execution before trusting cached handles, snapshots, semantic
  objects, dimensions, constraints, or validation results. Pixel mappings from a
  pre-edit snapshot are stale after geometry changes.

Tool and source priority:
1. Preserve explicit user/project/company/national standards, existing drawing
   handles, approved blocks, layers, styles, dimensions, and constraints.
2. Use purpose-built semantic CAD tools and domain workflows.
3. Use blocks/arrays for repetition, CAD tables for BOMs, true dimensions for
   measurements, hatches for sections, and regions/solids/booleans for 3D intent.
4. Use draw_line/draw_circle/draw_polyline only for genuinely simple one-off
   geometry or when no higher-level tool fits.
5. Use send_command only as an explicitly approved final escape hatch; it is raw
   AutoCAD command execution and is less validated.

Workflow routing rules:
- For existing or complex drawings, route through scan_all_entities with summary
  topology by default -> build_drawing_ir -> summarize_drawing ->
  analyze_drawing_intent -> detect_semantic_objects -> bind_all_dimensions ->
  extract_drawing_constraints -> check_drawing_constraints ->
  validate_geometry. Use explain_entity and local queries first; if primitive
  relations are still required, explicitly rescan with topology_detail="full"
  and keep the interpretation scoped to the relevant task/handles.
- For engineering drawings, assemblies, title blocks, BOMs, GD&T, surface
  finish notes, section/detail views, or exploded views, call
  analyze_engineering_drawing_stages and mapped visual review. Do not reduce
  these artifacts to generic lines and labels. Build a component register before
  BOMs/balloons and verify their item-number/quantity agreement together.
- For one-image mechanical drawing tracing, call prepare_image_trace, use the
  copy_drawing_from_image prompt with an Agent-side VLM, validate and submit
  ImageDrawingSpec/v1, compile it to a CADPlan, and run
  validate_image_fidelity_contract before CADPlan validation/dry-run/execution.
  Do not simplify chamfers, fillets, holes, slots, arrays, dimensions, hatches,
  BOMs, or title blocks into plain rectangles, loose lines, or text.
- For new complex drawings, start with recommend_cad_tools(intent), then create
  a CADPlan using semantic operations, variables, handle capture, dependencies,
  supported step-level `expect` metadata, and executable postconditions. Keep the broader
  acceptance criteria outside the CADPlan and verify them after rescan. Validate
  and dry-run before execution.
- For rectangles, polygons, splines, donuts, mlines, arrays, blocks, hatches,
  dimensions, leaders, 3D solids, trims, fillets, chamfers, offsets, and
  transforms, use the named tool. Do not rebuild them from draw_line,
  draw_circle, draw_polyline, or repeated copy_entity calls.
- Vision-capable models can SEE the drawing directly through the MCP. Call
  render_drawing_view to export the current view AND receive it as inline image
  content in one step, get_snapshot_image to look at the latest exported view,
  view_image to look at any local file (e.g. a source drawing to copy), and
  get_trace_source_image to look at a prepared image-trace source. Use this
  perceive→act-by-handle→re-render→verify loop instead of editing blind. These
  tools only read/export review artifacts and must not be replaced with visible
  helper geometry. (export_view_image / export_view_image_with_mapping still
  exist when mapped path artifacts or VLM sidecars are needed.)
- Use add_spatial_annotation/list_spatial_annotations for model-private labels,
  pointers, and part names. These annotations live only in the MCP SQLite
  database and must not create layers, XData, blocks, or visible marks in DWG.
- If unsure which tool to use, call recommend_cad_tools(intent) or
  get_tool_help(tool_name) before drawing. Use cad://tool-selection,
  cad://tools, and cad://drawing/current/tool-guide as compact indexes.

## Recommended workflow
0. Preflight: call check_runtime_environment(check_autocad=True) before live
   CAD work; fix required blockers before drawing or editing.
1. Classify the request: existing drawing understanding, new drawing from
   specification, repair, VLM review, image trace, or export/plot. Load the
   matching specialized prompt when the client supports explicit MCP prompts.
2. Establish acceptance criteria and units before planning. For existing work,
   record document/space/units, structured state, and a visual baseline when
   appearance matters.
3. Existing or complex drawing: scan_all_entities with summary topology by
   default, build_drawing_ir, summarize_drawing, analyze_drawing_intent,
   detect_semantic_objects, bind_all_dimensions, extract/check constraints,
   and validate_geometry. Use cad://drawing/current/ir/overview for fast
   orientation and selected full topology only when needed.
4. Engineering drawing or assembly: preserve views, sections, BOMs, title
   blocks, GD&T, hatches, dimensions, and repeated parts. Build the component
   register before BOMs/balloons; verify quantities and item numbers together.
5. New complex drawing: use recommend_cad_tools(intent), then a bounded CADPlan
   with explicit units/layers, variables, save_as handles, dependencies,
   supported step-level `expect` metadata, and executable postconditions. Keep broader
   acceptance criteria outside the plan for post-execution verification.
6. One-image mechanical trace: prepare_image_trace, use the
   copy_drawing_from_image prompt with an Agent-side VLM, validate/submit
   ImageDrawingSpec/v1, compile_image_spec_to_cad_plan, and run
   validate_image_fidelity_contract before CADPlan validation and dry-run.
7. For new geometry, plan layers before drawing and prefer color="bylayer".
   For existing drawings, reuse verified layer/style/block definitions instead
   of creating duplicates.
8. Pick the named tool for the intent: rectangle, polygon, block, hatch,
   dimension, leader, array, fillet, chamfer, trim, offset, 3D solid, etc.
9. Edit by handle with editing tools; do not delete and redraw just to move,
   mirror, scale, offset, trim, or array.
10. Dimension with add_*_dimension or add_qdim; never fake dimensions with text
   and lines.
11. Validate and dry-run every multi-step modification. Execute with
    transactional protection when permission is already present; obtain a new
    decision only for ambiguity, destructive scope, or material scope expansion.
12. Verify structurally and visually after each committed modification batch or
    semantic phase. Prefer
    render_drawing_view when the model must see the result; use mapped exports,
    overlays, and tiles when grounding is needed. Never trust success alone.
13. Model-private context: use add_spatial_annotation/list_spatial_annotations
   for hidden part labels or pointer-style references; do not draw helper
   labels into the DWG for model memory.
14. If verification finds a confirmed mismatch, repair through another
    validated and dry-run plan. Stop after two automatic verify/repair cycles
    unless the user asks to continue. Create review snapshots as needed, but
    save or produce deliverable exports only when requested.

When unsure, call recommend_cad_tools(intent). For a full generated index, use
get_tool_help() or resource cad://tools.

drawing, inspect and reuse verified layer, linetype, color, plot, text-style,
dimension-style, and block definitions; create only what is genuinely missing.
Prefer entity properties set to ByLayer unless the project standard requires an
override.

### Recommended layer naming

Simplified AIA-style prefixes:

| Discipline | Prefix | Examples |
|------------|--------|----------|
| Architecture | A- | A-WALL, A-DOOR, A-WINDOW |
| Structure | S- | S-COLUMN, S-BEAM, S-FOUND |
| Electrical | E- | E-LIGHT, E-POWER, E-DATA |
| Mechanical/HVAC | M- | M-DUCT, M-PIPE |
| Plumbing | P- | P-COLD, P-HOT, P-DRAIN |
| Dimensions | DIM- | DIM-PLAN, DIM-SECTION |
| Text/notes | TEXT- | TEXT-NOTE, TEXT-TITLE |

### Color conventions

- ACI 1 red / ACI 6 magenta: primary construction elements.
- ACI 4 cyan / ACI 3 green: secondary or reference elements.
- ACI 5 blue: dimensions and annotation.
- ACI 252-254 gray: underlays and references.

### Typical setup

Before drawing, create layers explicitly:
```
create_layer("A-WALL", color=1)      # wall layer
create_layer("A-DOOR", color=3)      # door layer
create_layer("A-WINDOW", color=4)    # window layer
create_layer("DIM-PLAN", color=5)    # plan dimensions
create_layer("TEXT-NOTE", color=7)   # notes
```
